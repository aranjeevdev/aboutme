## :book: Executive Summary

* I am a Techno-Functional Architect with over 18 years of experience sitting at the intersection of Healthcare IT and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. My career has been defined by a deep fascination with interoperability—taking disparate systems like Hospital EMRs and making them "talk" fluently to enterprise platforms like Oracle Fusion HCM and SCM.
* I don’t just build integrations; I design the digital nervous systems of modern hospitals. Whether I am automating complex HR workflows with Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC), architecting data migrations with HDL, or translating clinical KPIs into BI dashboards using BI Tools , my goal is always to turn fragmented data into actionable business intelligence.
